# House Price Estimator

A machine learning regression model to predict house prices based on various features such as location, area, number of bedrooms, and additional amenities. This project also includes data visualization to show the distribution of house prices and feature importance.

## Project Overview

The House Price Estimator uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on the following features:
- Area (size of the house)
- Number of bedrooms and bathrooms
- Stories (number of floors)
- Availability of amenities (e.g., guestroom, air conditioning, hot water heating)
- Parking spots, and more.

The project includes data preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and model training using `RandomForestRegressor` or `LinearRegression` from the `scikit-learn` library. The model's performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes numerical data, and encodes categorical features.
- **Machine Learning**: Implements multiple regression models (`RandomForestRegressor`, `LinearRegression`).
- **Model Evaluation**: Uses MAE and RMSE metrics to evaluate model performance.
- **Visualization**: Includes visualizations for actual vs predicted house prices and feature importance.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pip (Python package manager)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-estimator.git
cd house-price-estimator
```

### Install Dependencies

To install the required Python packages, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The `requirements.txt` file should contain:
```txt
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn
```

### Dataset

Ensure that the dataset (`house_data.csv`) is located in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

### Running the Model

To train the model and evaluate it, simply run:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will:
- Load the dataset
- Preprocess the data
- Train the regression model
- Display evaluation metrics and visualizations

### Example Output

```bash
Mean Absolute Error: 456789
Root Mean Squared Error: 987654
```

## Data Description

The dataset contains 13 columns and 545 rows. Each row represents a house with the following features:

| Column Name        | Description                                      |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `price`            | Target variable: the price of the house (in USD)  |
| `area`             | The area of the house (in sq. ft.)                |
| `bedrooms`         | Number of bedrooms                               |
| `bathrooms`        | Number of bathrooms                              |
| `stories`          | Number of floors in the house                    |
| `mainroad`         | Whether the house is near the main road (yes/no)  |
| `guestroom`        | Whether the house has a guestroom (yes/no)        |
| `basement`         | Whether the house has a basement (yes/no)         |
| `hotwaterheating`  | Whether the house has hot water heating (yes/no)  |
| `airconditioning`  | Whether the house has air conditioning (yes/no)   |
| `parking`          | Number of parking spots                          |
| `prefarea`         | Preferred area or locality (yes/no)               |
| `furnishingstatus` | Furnishing status (furnished, semi-furnished, unfurnished) |

## Model Training

The model pipeline includes:
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Imputation of missing values, scaling of numerical features, and one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
2. **Model**: Either `RandomForestRegressor` or `LinearRegression`.
3. **Model Training**: The model is trained on 80% of the data and tested on the remaining 20%.

## Evaluation

After training, the model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions.
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Measures the square root of the average squared differences between predicted and actual values.

## Visualization

The following visualizations are included:
- **House Price Distribution**: Displays the distribution of house prices.
- **Actual vs Predicted Prices**: Scatter plot comparing actual and predicted house prices.
- **Feature Importance**: Bar plot showing the most important features for predicting house prices (for tree-based models like `RandomForestRegressor`).
